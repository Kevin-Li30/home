				One of my main interests is computers,I have been researching, studying, and looking at computers in my spare time for years now. I have built, taken apart, 
				and fixed computers many times and the computer I currently use at home is a computer that I built. A lot of people are scared
				of building computers when it is actually very simple. I started learning about computers because when my brother was in high school
				he built a computer and when I saw it I was interested in the topic and wanted to learn more about it. Ever since then I have been keeping up with the latest news about computers, fixing computers(mainly my own computer)
				, and helping my friends make lists for computers that they are planning on building.

				Another one of my interests is playing video games, some of my favourite things are Minecraft, League of legends, and Valorant.
				I like to play video games that are competitive as it makes the game more fun and you feel like your playing to earn something. I also
				like playing games that are more sandbox like for example Minecraft or Genshin Impact. I played a lot of video games during the summer in quarantine when I had nothing else to do but
				now that school and volleyball practices are back I have less and less time to do things im interested in like playing video games.
