			<p>
				As you may or may not know the school I currently go to is Victoria Park Collegiate Institute. I chose to go to Victoria Park because of many reasons, I wanted to attend the IB program,
				and because I didn't want to travel very far to get to school anymore. Those are the main 2 reasons I wanted to go to Victoria Park for high school, it was convenient and there was a good 
				program I wanted to attend.

			<h2>Don Mills Middle School</h2><!--Explain why I went to don mills-->

			<p>
				I have been to many schools before coming to Victoria Park. For middle school I went to Don Mills Middle School and was in the CyberArts program. I chose to do the CyberArts program
				because I was convinced by my art teacher to join CyberArts, plus it was only 2 busses away so it wasnt too inconvenient. I ended up liking the program and staying in it all the way until
				grade 8 when I left CyberArts to go to IB instead.

			<p class="cassandratxt">
				The elementry school I went to right after moving to the area I currently live in now is Cassandra P.S. I started there in grade 2 and stayed all the way until grade 5. For my grade 4 and 5 years I took
				the extended french program to help with my french. Most of my classmates from that school went to the same middle school but I was one of the only ones to go to a different school than everybody else.
