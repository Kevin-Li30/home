		<h2>Volleyball</h2>
		<p><!--Explain why I play volleyball-->
			My favourite sport is volleyball, I have been playing volleyball competitively for 3 years now and this year will be my 4th. I play for the 15U Boys team at REACH volleyball club, last year
			my team ended up ranking 9th going into provincials, but our season ended early due to COVID-19. I was also unable to play half of the season because I had fractured my wrist while snowboarding.
			My first time playing volleyball was actually in grade 4 when I joined the school volleyball team and that was my first actual experience playing volleyball but I had never expected
			that I would play competitively at that time. The positions I play are setter and right side, my main position is setter and I play right side as like a secondary position.
			I played select hockey for 3 years in a row before deciding to switch to volleyball.But after 6 
			years to I decided I didnt want to play hockey anymore so I could pursue playing volleyball, the first time I played in an official volleyball tournament I instantly liked it and
			from that point on I knew the next season I would completely stop playing hockey and focus on volleyball. (This image is about 1 year old now)
